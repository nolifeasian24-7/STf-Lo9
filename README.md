A little bot, originally based of the jetbrains simple chatty bot project, however, i wanted something a little more advanced. One of my most advanced projects to date! Feel free to give some feedback! and yes, there will be revisions too, and eventually, a JAR form of this file.

Also, check out my friend spicyChair! i used his mini minesweeper code as a game for you to play with my bot!
